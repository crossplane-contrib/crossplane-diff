# Named Docker containers for performance optimization in concurrent processing tests.
#
# These annotations enable container reuse across multiple XR renders, providing significant
# performance benefits when processing many XRs with the same functions:
# - Without named containers: ~45 seconds for 21 XRs (creates new containers each time)
# - With named containers: ~6.7 seconds for 21 XRs (reuses containers after first creation)
#
# IMPORTANT: These annotations are ONLY used in this 21-file concurrent test where the
# performance benefit is substantial. Other e2e tests (single XR) don't include these
# annotations since they don't benefit meaningfully from container reuse.
#
# Production behavior: crossplane-diff uses mutex-only serialization without requiring
# users to annotate their Function resources, ensuring production compatibility while
# still preventing Docker daemon overload issues.
